An AI tool based on multivariate neural networks, which, given an elevation map of an Earth-like planet, predicts the climate and renders the imagined satellite view of the planet in equirectangular projection.

Created using Python (numpy, matplotlib, pytorch, flask), Javascript, and HTMl/CSS.

Made for Hack the MIST 2023 by Edwin Chen and Richard Yin.
